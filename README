Precompiler for CodeMash 2010 (2.0.1.0)

ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS FROM CLIENT
high-level features should look like:

* From a source, pull speaker name, session title, time 
* Attendees can browse sessions
	* Lean approach: one list to scroll through
		* Sort by speaker name, time, or session title
* Attendees rate session
	* Red (wouldn't attend again), Green (definitely attend again),
White (neutral -- "yellow" has other negative connotations, IMO)
	* Enable moderate length plain text comments


* Conference admins can browse each session/speaker to see a roll up summary
of ratings
	* Red == -1, white == 0, green == +1
	* Comments listed one per line or block so it's clear -- not just
everything appended.

* Focus on functionality, not bling. I don't give a rat's ass about
Silverlight 4.0 / Flex 25.2 / bullshit RIA of the day. I will puke if I see
spinning wheels.

* (Bling would be fine AFTER the system works)

Extras in top-down order
* Cookies or some other trickery to block script kiddies gaming the system
* Query to search for speaker or session
