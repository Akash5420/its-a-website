The following application is part of the CodeMash 2010 Precompiler event. 
We are using this time to have a full day to construct a simple but useful way
to communicate information about the conference to the organizers, speakers and 
sponsors. 

In this agile workshop we're using the following technologies and methodologies 
to make this happen. If you have any questions please contact CodeMash conference 
coordinators or Leon Gersing (leon@edgecase.com) who will be acting Agile Coach 
for the precompiler event. 

  Site:         Ruby on Rails (see /app)
  Testing:      RSpec + Cucumber (see /features and /spec)
  Gems:         TBD
  Host:         Heroku.com
  Source:       Github.com
  CI:           RunCodeRun.com
  Database:     Postgresql
  Methodology:  Agile - Kanban board
  Point Scale:  1..3 #=> 1: 30 min, 2: 60min, 3: 90min

Event Schedule: 

  8:00  :         Iteration 0pen - First Standup
  10:00 :         Iteration Close0/Open1 - Standup
  12:00 :         Iteration Close1/Open2 - Standup

After the time is up, if folks are interested in continuing work on the conference 
application they are welcome to continue to iterate via Pivitoltracker.com where 
they will have access to the backlog. 

While we will have a contingency plan in place for the change that we will not make our
timeline to launch we are operating under the assumption that we're building a production 
ready application for use by the conference attendees beginning the day after the precompiler concludes. 

There will be more information available during the event so stop by if you're interested 
in helping out, learning from your peers and building something together.
